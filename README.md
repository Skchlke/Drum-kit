The Drum Kitü•Å Project is a web-based application that simulates a drum set. 
Users can interact with virtual drum pads displayed on the screen, and each pad corresponds to a specific drum sound. 
When a user clicks on a drum pad, the application plays the appropriate sound and provides visual feedback through animations. 
Built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling and animations, and JavaScript for interactivity, this project offers an engaging way to explore rhythm and sound in a fun and dynamic way.

In this drum kit project, event listeners are primarily used to handle user interactions through mouse clicks. Each drum pad is an interactive element with an attached `click` event listener. When a user clicks on a drum pad, the event listener triggers a function that plays the corresponding drum sound and adds a visual animation to enhance the user experience. This approach ensures seamless interaction and creates a dynamic and engaging application. By using event listeners, the application can efficiently respond to user actions and maintain its interactivity.
